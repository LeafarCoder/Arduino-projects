<b>Knock it Open</b>

In this project me and my team (André Miranda, André Vieira, Manuel Madeira and Tiago Rodrigues) built a fake book safe meant to keep any small yet important object one possesses.

To unlock the safe one must knock a specific sequence onto the book surface.

We submitted this ideia and participated on the 2nd edition of <a href="http://www.tecstorm.pt/index.html">TecStorm</a>, a portuguese 48h technological event much like a hackathon for university student. There was time to code, 3D print, brainstorm, solder and of course have a lot of fun!
