<b>Knock it Open</b>

In this project me and my team (André Miranda, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9-vieira-05119613b/>André Vieira</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-madeira-5b717513b/">Manuel Madeira</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiago-rodrigues-4055ba136/">Tiago Rodrigues</a>) built a fake book safe meant to keep any small yet important object one possesses.

To unlock the safe one must knock a specific sequence onto the book surface. The knock sequence is easily editable once the safe is open.
Here we present a book as the prototype but other models can be used making it easy to blend in the house environment.

We submitted this idea and participated in the 2nd edition of <a href="http://www.tecstorm.pt/index.html">TecStorm</a>, a Portuguese 48h technological event much like a hackathon for university student. There was time to code, 3D print, brainstorm, solder and of course have a lot of fun!
